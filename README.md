These are some of the Python Projects I have worked on.

1. Web_Transfer_GUI.py is a file transfer program that transfers files to another location that are newer than 24 hours old. 
2. PhoneBook.py is a simple phone book program.
3. PasswordFinal.py is a password storage progam that is used in an Interior Design business for storing account credentials for the myriad
accounts that need to be kept track of in interior design.
